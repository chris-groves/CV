## Chris Groves

**Junior Full Stack Developer**

I began my studies at Makers Academy after a distinguished career in the Probation Service. I succeeded in various roles, gaining experience of business support, data extraction and analysis and software training. 

My last role as a trainer gave me a great insight into how users interact with applications; I enjoyed seeing the value that new features would bring to my colleagues. This sparked my curiosity as to how software is developed - I wanted to create these features and led me to choose a career as a developer. Moving forward I am excited about learning, growing and building applications that add real value to users as part of a supportive and ambitious team.

## Skills

### Committed Learner

As an IT Trainer I supported a team who worked with people convicted of sexual offences when a new application was released to manage their work. I began by learning the application's functionality and day to day team processes. This ensured the team could use the application effectively for their needs.

Whilst studying at Makers, I picked up the ability to learn new languages and technologies. For my final team project I used Unity, C# and Visual Studio, with no prior experience, to bring the Dragon Pirates game to life. Since finishing the course I have learnt Python and its Unittest testing framework from scratch to write a 'Fizzbuzz' programme.

### Teamwork

I collaborated with my IT trainer counterparts to produce a national curriculum. I was a new trainer at the time so it was a great opportunity to learn from more experienced colleagues and offer my fresh ideas. I co-wrote lesson plans and supporting documents, feeding back on work done by others. The result was a set of materials which could be used by new and experienced trainers alike to ensure consistent training across the country. I enjoyed seeing how working together, with our varying knowledge and experience, produced a great outcome.

### Communication

I have strong communication skills, demonstrated during the Makers Facebook clone project. I researched continuous integration technology options to use in our project, playing an integral role in the decision made with a clear explanation of my findings and positive engagement in the team discussion. I led stand-ups and retros during the project, sharing my thoughts and encouraging everyone to contribute. I wrote clear commit messages such as ‘feat: restrict password length to max 10 characters’ and used a clear name for a feature branch: ‘likes-on-comments’. My efforts ensured the team collaborated effectively and produced a good Ruby on Rails product at the end of the two weeks.

### Coaching

I have enjoyed the coaching experience gained as a trainer and at Makers. To compliment my love of learning, I am enthusiastic about sharing my knowledge and experience with others. I regularly attended process workshops at Makers which involved observing a fellow student tackle a problem, providing feedback on their process at the end. I paired with a variety of students, some further through the course than myself, others less so. It was great to support fellow students, regardless of their position in relation to mine. It provided a great opportunity to reflect and further my own understanding too.
