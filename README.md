## Chris Groves

A full stack junior developer and an August 2019 graduate of the Makers Academy software development bootcamp. 

Prior to attending the bootcamp, I taught staff in the National Probation Service how to get the best from the organisation's internal software and applications. I enjoyed learning new software and then presenting my understanding to staff in creative and engaging ways.

My role as a trainer gave me a great insight into how staff interact with applications. Colleagues would often ask about certain features and if they could be added or improved. At the time I did not know the technical answers to these but my desire to learn prompted me to investigate and ultimately chose a career in software development.


I am looking for my first role in a supportive and ambitous team where I can add value and grow as a developer.

## Skills

### Committed Learner

Working as an IT Trainer required me to always learn new applications and features. I needed to not only understand the new content but also be prepared to share it with staff whilst linking it to businesses processes. I supported a team who worked with service users convicted of sexual offences when a new application was released to manage their work. I began by learning the application's functionality and then linking this to day to day team operations, such as booking service users onto class sessions and recording attendance. Offered drop in training sessions and bespoke sessions for new starters etc - always learning from staff

Whilst studying at Makers Academy, I picked up the ability to learn new programming languages. The first half of the course was Ruby based, with JavaScript introduced half way through. Since finishing the course I have learnt Python and its Unittest testing framework from scratch to write a 'Fizzbuzz' programme (https://github.com/chris-groves/FizzBuzz-Python-Unittest).


Makers - 'hard' and 'soft' skills - Fizzbuzz Python
Parent - constantly developing, need to learn something new - new taste in food, new taste in nursery rhymes, change in sleeping pattern
