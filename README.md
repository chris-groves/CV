## Chris Groves

**Junior Full Stack Developer**

I began my studies at Makers Academy after a distinguished career in the Probation Servics. I succeeded in various roles, gaining experience of business support, data extraction and analysis and software training. 

My last role as a trainer gave me a great insight into how users interact with applications; I enjoyed seeing the value that new features would bring to my colleagues. This sparked my curiosity as to how software is developed and led me to choose a career as a developer. Moving forward I am excited about learning, growing and building applications that add real value to users as part of a supportive and ambitious team.

## Skills

### Committed Learner

Working as an IT Trainer required me to always learn new applications and features. I needed to not only understand the new content but also be prepared to share it with staff whilst linking it to businesses processes. I supported a team who worked with service users convicted of sexual offences when a new application was released to manage their work. I began by learning the application's functionality and then linking this to day to day team operations, such as booking service users onto class sessions and recording attendance. 

Whilst studying at Makers Academy, I picked up the ability to learn new languages and technologies. For my final team project I used Unity, C# and Visual Studio, with no prior experience, to bring the Dragon Pirates game to life. Since finishing the course I have learnt Python and its Unittest testing framework from scratch to write a 'Fizzbuzz' programme.

### Teamwork

I am great at working with others to produce outcomes. Working as an IT Trainer, I collaborated with my counterparts across the country to produce a national curriculum. I was a new trainer at the time so it was a good opportunity to learn from more experienced colleagues and also offer fresh ideas. I co-wrote lesson plans and materials which were reviewed by my colleagues and provided my own feedback on work done by others. The result was a suite of lesson plans and materials which could be used by new and experienced trainers alike to ensure consistent content in training sessions across the country.
